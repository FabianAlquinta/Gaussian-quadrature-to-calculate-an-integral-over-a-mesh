# Gaussian-quadrature-to-calculate-an-integral-over-a-mesh

This is a Python code to calcule an integral over the function f(x,y) = 5ysin(x)^2 + 3x^2 + 5y^2 + 5xy using gaussian quadrature as numerical method.
This code read meshes exported with "Gmsh"
You can work with this code to different meshes to calculate different functions
